## Project Overview

This project will implement both Virtual Reality and the Haply Inverse3 Controllers to create an immersive surgery simulation. The user will be in a virtual surgery room using the Inverse3 as medical tools to perform a simulation of surgery. This project’s intended applications are for medical professionals as practice and for medical students for learning. Our solution is a 3D virtual human cadaver with vitals and organ systems susceptible to user interaction, with the ability to reset and save progress to further the user’s learning experience.
